After talking to over 500 home service contractors over the last year we repeatedly have heard that dealing with customer communications is the single biggest pain point for pros.

Created by a mother and her two sons.\n\nWhen Helen Lo had back issues and needed the perfect bag that kept up with her frequent travels, she set out to find it.  Unfortunately, the options were either too heavy, too frumpy, too tech-y, overpriced, overly designed, or pocketless black holes.\n\nAfter watching their mother abandon yet another bag, her sons suggested she invent one herself.  But as a woman in her mid-60s, she wondered how she would ever get from Point A to Point B.  So eventually devoted sons Jan and Derek ditched their respective day jobs in advertising and product design research (and nightly gigs as DJ\u2019s) to help make Helen's dream a reality.\n\nLo & Sons bags are built to travel light without compromising functionality and style.  Every single high-quality feature was designed to meet the needs of frequent travelers, movers and shakers.  Each bag is thoughtfully designed with features like meticulously placed pockets, compartments for tech essentials, and elements for smooth travels like an adjustable sleeve for sliding over suitcase handles.

Created by a mother and her two sons.\n\nWhen Helen Lo had back issues and needed the perfect bag that kept up with her frequent travels, she set out to find it.  Unfortunately, the options were either too heavy, too frumpy, too tech-y, overpriced, overly designed, or pocketless black holes.\n\nAfter watching their mother abandon yet another bag, her sons suggested she invent one herself.  But as a woman in her mid-60s, she wondered how she would ever get from Point A to Point B.  So eventually devoted sons Jan and Derek ditched their respective day jobs in advertising and product design research (and nightly gigs as DJ\u2019s) to help make Helen's dream a reality.\n\nLo & Sons bags are built to travel light without compromising functionality and style.  Every single high-quality feature was designed to meet the needs of frequent travelers, movers and shakers.  Each bag is thoughtfully designed with features like meticulously placed pockets, compartments for tech essentials, and elements for smooth travels like an adjustable sleeve for sliding over suitcase handles.

          "The world faces an increasingly disastrous conflict built on the assumption that Big Oil must oppose climate change initiatives to continue making profits. Until today, the thinking has been that it is a zero-sum game that can have only one winner. However, recent technology advances enable a solution in which, simultaneously, Big Oil can profit and the climate can improve. This solution\u2014RACE (Reduce All Carbon Emissions)\u2014is the brainchild of a group of tech gurus, ecommerce experts, climate scientists, oil executives, fund managers, and public utility policy makers. Although it may seem that reducing carbon dioxide emissions must also lead to reduced oil profits and dividends, this is not necessarily the case. There are already two major industries that see margins grow by promoting conservation and encouraging reduced consumption; namely, residential electricity and water. These utilities use tiered pricing to maintain healthy profits while incentivizing conservation. Similarly, by working together on RACE, gasoline retailers can implement universal tiered pricing at the pump. Tiered pricing allows gas prices to remain low for users who use up to or below their base allocation, while users who consume above their gas allocation pay an escalating price. With RACE, all licensed drivers receive an allocation for an equal number of gallons of gas that they may purchase at the lowest tier price level. The more gas an individual consumes, the higher the price per gallon. With RACE, this all works automatically, just like water and electric bill charges are automatically adjusted based on individual consumption levels. RACE solves the last remaining challenge to implement this at scale: How to automatically calculate individual gas prices across all gas brands and retail locations. Just as credit card companies like VISA and Mastercard can account for your purchases across different retail brands, RACE can account for your gas purchases across different retailers and locations. This solution leverages the power of direct economic incentives to reduce consumption and encourage conservation. With the RACE solution, profits and dividends can grow as consumption and production falls, while helping to save the environment\u2014a win-win scenario for all.",

          "The world faces an increasingly disastrous conflict built on the assumption that Big Oil must oppose climate change initiatives to continue making profits. Until today, the thinking has been that it is a zero-sum game that can have only one winner. However, recent technology advances enable a solution in which, simultaneously, Big Oil can profit and the climate can improve. This solution\u2014RACE (Reduce All Carbon Emissions)\u2014is the brainchild of a group of tech gurus, ecommerce experts, climate scientists, oil executives, fund managers, and public utility policy makers. Although it may seem that reducing carbon dioxide emissions must also lead to reduced oil profits and dividends, this is not necessarily the case. There are already two major industries that see margins grow by promoting conservation and encouraging reduced consumption; namely, residential electricity and water. These utilities use tiered pricing to maintain healthy profits while incentivizing conservation. Similarly, by working together on RACE, gasoline retailers can implement universal tiered pricing at the pump. Tiered pricing allows gas prices to remain low for users who use up to or below their base allocation, while users who consume above their gas allocation pay an escalating price. With RACE, all licensed drivers receive an allocation for an equal number of gallons of gas that they may purchase at the lowest tier price level. The more gas an individual consumes, the higher the price per gallon. With RACE, this all works automatically, just like water and electric bill charges are automatically adjusted based on individual consumption levels. RACE solves the last remaining challenge to implement this at scale: How to automatically calculate individual gas prices across all gas brands and retail locations. Just as credit card companies like VISA and Mastercard can account for your purchases across different retail brands, RACE can account for your gas purchases across different retailers and locations. This solution leverages the power of direct economic incentives to reduce consumption and encourage conservation. With the RACE solution, profits and dividends can grow as consumption and production falls, while helping to save the environment\u2014a win-win scenario for all.",

As young people with decades of life ahead, our generation has the most at stake with climate change. If we don't step up, it's unclear who else will. That's why we're changing the game.\n\nWe are laser focused on carbon dividends because it's a cornerstone solution that can actually pass and actually work. And we're mobilizing student leaders across the country around special missions that create the conditions for victory. \n\nThe carbon dividends strategy is already supported by the broadest climate coalition in American history, including the largest statement of economists of all time. It is also endorsed by hundreds of Student Body Presidents from all 50 states\u2014the largest declaration of student leaders in US history.\n\nThat's because carbon dividends is a solution where all sides would win. It would cut emissions fast, while also driving clean energy innovation, creating jobs, protecting our families and communities, and ensuring continued opportunity and prosperity.\n\nTogether, we can save the world (actually).

          "Capchase is an early-stage startup aiming to radically transform how SaaS companies fund their growth by allowing them to receive upfront cash for contracts they sign with customers. We are shaping a new way for software companies to finance their growth (it's not us who say it, it's the Wall Street Journal (https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-tap-upfront-cash-alternative-to-venture-capital-11602096059))\n\nTo carry out this mission, we've received $4.6M(https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/capchase-raises-4-6m-to-deliver-fast-cash-to-saas-companies/) in funding (and an extra $5M credit line) from some of the best seed-stage VCs in the business like Bling Capital(https://www.blingcap.com/) (Airtable, Gitlab, Lyft, Square\u2026), SciFI(https://scifi.vc/) (CEO was PayPal co-founder) or Box Group (https://boxgroup.com/) (Amplitude, Stripe\u2026). You'll be able to get in touch with some of the best product people in Silicon Valley. Additionally, we recently closed a $60M credit facility (https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/capchase-nabs-60m-in-credit-to-help-founders-avoid-dilution/) to power our financial products.",

You'll have to partner up with your non-technical counterparty to perfectly understand the issues that show up and make sure the fixes are correctly communicated. This is key to the business as the learning will reinforce the product.\nTesting the s**t out of the app and code. The best customer support is a good QA. By creating automated tests that are tailored to our features, we'll be able to detect bugs ahead of time and improve the client experience. This is critical as we're not quite playing with fire, but with money \ud83e\udd11 (which is arguably worse).\nAutomate the data retrieval. At this stage we're figuring out which are the best data sources to enhance our product. In the beginning, it makes sense to gather information manually, but we'll need to quickly shift to automated scripts.\nManage our third party services. We connect with several platforms that serve different purposes: moving cash between accounts, connecting to our client's systems, etc. Your mission is to ensure a seamless connection between our platform and third party backends.\nMaster the API game. We use tons of APIs that come in all shapes and sizes. Your duty will be to fully understand how these APIs are structured, what they provide, and how their endpoints look like. \nStrategize around the logic of the entire system. We need your input to think about the general architecture of the product. If you're good at coming up with edge cases, this is your game.",

Python and/or Javascript (Node, React) are the preferred ones. Golang is also fine; the new kid in the block. No professional experience required, but good if you programmed through some side projects.\nProbably the most important bit: ambitious and extremely avid to learn and get things done.
